# v2.2.1
- Updated colors to match new site design.
- Fixed a bug causing follow zones to do nothing when clicked.

# v2.2.0
- Added new list-style display, used for new docked component design, new panel type, and as a new mobile view.
- List style display allows edits from any place the extension is visible: config page, dashboard, or channel page.
- When mounted as a component or panel simply provides a list of channels to follow that can be added or removed in realtime.
- When mounted as a video overlay, all old behavior remains including custom layouts with buttons and zones.
